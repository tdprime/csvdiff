Motivated by https://aswinkarthik.github.io/csvdiff/

Requirements:

- compare schema (by header row)
	- unordered: columns added and removed
		- set operations
	- ordered: column moved
		- traditional diff on two lists

- compare data
	- do better than line compare
	- compare with schema
	- ordered: rows remade to schema
		- traditional diff on rows
	- unordered: perhaps with key (ordered subset)
		- database operations
	- each pair of rows compared, score by # matched fields
